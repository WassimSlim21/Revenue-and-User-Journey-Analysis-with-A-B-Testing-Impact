# Revenue and User Journey Analysis with A/B Version Testing Impact

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides in-depth analysis of user journeys, revenue impact, and performance differences between A/B versions of a product. The dashboard enables stakeholders to assess the impact of different product versions, identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize user engagement strategies.

## Dashboard Structure

### Page 1: Revenue and User Journey Analysis

#### Filters & Slicers
- **By Steps**: Filter data based on specific steps in the user journey
- **By Product**: Filter analysis based on specific products
- **By Version**: Toggle between different product versions (A/B)
- **By Life Cycle**: Focus on specific stages of the user lifecycle

#### Key Metrics (Cards)
- **CA (Chiffre d'Affaires)**: Total revenue generated
- **CA GAS**: Revenue from GAS product category
- **CA Elec**: Revenue from Elec product category
- **Users**: Total number of users in the analysis

#### Visualizations
- **Revenue by User Consumption (Table)**: Detailed breakdown of revenue by individual users
- **Time Spent per Step by Version (Line Chart)**: Analysis of time spent at each journey step, split by version
- **Users per Step (Funnel Chart)**: Visual representation of user drop-offs at each journey step
- **Valid vs. Invalid Users by Version (Pie Chart)**: Distribution of user validation status by version
- **Validation of Step Order (Table)**: Verification of users following correct journey steps
- **Step Order per User (Table)**: Detailed breakdown of each user's journey path

### Page 2: Impact of A/B Version Testing

#### Filters & Slicers
- **By Steps**: Filter analysis by journey steps
- **By Product**: Filter by product category
- **By Version**: Compare version A vs. version B
- **By Life Cycle**: Analyze differences across lifecycle stages

#### Statistical Metrics (Cards)
- **Variance A/B**: Variance in key metrics between versions
- **Mean Conversion Rate A/B**: Average conversion rates for both versions
- **Standard Deviation A/B**: Consistency measures for conversion rates
- **T Statistic**: Statistical significance indicator
- **P Value**: Probability that differences are due to chance

#### Visualizations
- **Conversion Rate by Step (Table)**: Comparison of conversion rates at each step
- **Conversion Rate by Day and Step (Table)**: Temporal analysis of conversion performance
- **Evolution of Conversion Rates (Line & Column Chart)**: Visual comparison of version performance by step
- **Daily Conversion Rate Trends (Line Chart)**: Day-by-day tracking of version performance differences

## Key Features
- Dynamic filtering capabilities for multi-dimensional analysis
- Statistical validation of A/B test results
- Visual identification of journey bottlenecks
- Revenue attribution by user segment and product category
- Temporal tracking of conversion performance

## Business Value
This dashboard enables:
- Data-driven optimization of the user journey
- Quantifiable assessment of version improvements
- Identification of high-value user segments
- Early detection of conversion issues
- Revenue forecasting based on journey performance

## Technical Implementation
Built using Microsoft Power BI with:
- DAX measures for statistical calculations
